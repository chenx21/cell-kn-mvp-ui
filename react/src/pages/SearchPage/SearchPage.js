          The National Library of Medicine (NLM) Cell Knowledge Network is a knowledgebase focused
          on cell characteristics (phenotypes) derived from single-cell technologies. It integrates
          this information with data from reference ontologies, NCBI resources, and text mining
          efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The network is structured as a knowledge graph of biomedical entities (nodes) and their
          relationships (edges). This graph links experimental single-cell genomics data to the
          reference Cell Ontology, providing evidence for assertions and integrating information
          about cells, tissues, biomarkers, pathways, drugs, and diseases.
        </p>

          Use the search bar above to find and explore entities within this network. You can add
          items to your graph or navigate to their specific pages.
